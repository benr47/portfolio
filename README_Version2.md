# Minimalist Resume Portfolio

This is a minimalist personal portfolio site for showcasing your resume, projects, and contact information.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Main page with all sections.
- `style.css` – Minimal, clean styling.
- `script.js` – Simple navigation interactions.
- `assets/` – (Optional) Place images or resume PDFs here.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

1. Push these files to a new GitHub repository (e.g., `benr47/portfolio`).
2. Go to your repository's **Settings** → **Pages**.
3. Under "Source", select branch (e.g., `main`) and root (`/`).
4. Save, and your site will be live at `https://benr47.github.io/portfolio/`.

## Customization

- Update content in `index.html` (About, Resume, Projects, Contact).
- Add project links or images in `assets/` as needed.
- Tweak colors and fonts in `style.css`.
